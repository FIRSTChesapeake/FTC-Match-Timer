    <h3>Introduction to the timer</h3>
    This application is designed to manage a virtually unlimited number of fields within a single division.<br/>
    After the initial setup, the 'server' system will comunicate with the 'client' clocks over the network (UDP).<br/>
    If you've used this application before, your previous settings will be listed on the next page.<br/>
    If not, or if you need to setup a completely different event, this wizard will guide you through the configuration process.
